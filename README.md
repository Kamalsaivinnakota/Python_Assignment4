# Python_Assignment4

This repository contains solutions for two tasks from the **Python Certification Program by Tute Dude**, focused on file handling using Python. These tasks are part of **Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python**.

## ðŸ§  Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### ðŸ”§ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints its content line by line.
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

This task demonstrates how to perform safe file reading and error handling using `try-except` blocks in Python.

## ðŸ§  Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### ðŸ”§ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.
2. Appends additional data to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

This task shows how to write, append, and read from files in Python using file modes such as `'w'`, `'a'`, and `'r'`.

## ðŸ’» How to Run

Ensure Python is installed on your system. Then run the programs using:

```bash
Task1.py   # To read from sample.txt and handle errors
Task2.py   # To write, append, and read from output.txt
